            <div id="main_text">Dot Daht aims to be a community built website, where the community votes on the next HTML page to add.  This is just the very beginning so there isn't a lot here yet, but I hope there soon will be.
                   <br> This page will be expanding as I think of stuff, so make sure to check back every once and a while. </div>



                    If you have suggestions, please post them, in the sub-reddit <a href="https://reddit.com/r/dotdaht">https://reddit.com/r/dotdaht</a>

                    <b>PROCESS</b>
                    <br>
                        Every Friday, at 5PM MST, the top ten(10) highest voted submissions on the sub-reddit from the last week will be gathered and included in a poll that will last two(2) days until Monday 12AM.  At that point, the highest voted submission will be added to the website automatically, and the process repeats.

                    <br>1. All pages must be added by community vote.
                    <br>2. Submissions must adhere to the submission rules. All submissions in violation will be removed from consideration or deleted from the site.
                    <br>3. If a page with the same path of another page is voted in, it will overwrite the existing file.
                    <br>4. index.html and faq.html are exempt from being overwritten.
                    <br>5. Anything is up for discussion in regards to how this site operates.
                    <br>6. I reserve the right to change or break said rules at any time.
                    <br>7. Sorry about the last one, but this is still a work in progress. I need that flexability.
